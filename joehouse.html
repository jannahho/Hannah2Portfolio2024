                <p class="desc">Figma prototyping project to design UI UX for fictional restaurant menu- starting with Graphic Treatments for Branding Identity, to Logos, to Digital Menu Interaction Prototyping <br> <br> Jo(e) House is a restaurant that invites both kids and adults to unleash their inner child and indulge in whimsy, while feeling right at home. The dishes are crafted with simple ingredients that offer a comforting taste, yet with a touch (or a ton) of obscurity that makes them exciting and new.
<br><br>
To capture the essence of the Jo(e) House brand, which is all about cozy playfulness, I explored different color palettes and typefaces that evoke familiarity and youthfulness. The logo and graphic treatments underwent several iterations until they embodied these brand values.

<br><br>The Print Menu, designed to entertain guests while they wait for their meal, features an interactive maze game and coloring-book-like design. It's always accompanied by crayons to encourage creativity and play. As I moved on to digital prototyping via Figma for the Screen Menu, I aimed to retain the element of interactivity by introducing a "Choose Your Drink" game that appeals to the playful side of adults who want to join in on the fun.</p>
